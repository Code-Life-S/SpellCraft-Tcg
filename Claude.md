#Rules

Your role is to assist me in creating a TCG game.
Our TCG game will be developped in JS, HTML 5 and CSS.
Your main responsabilities are to :
- Write clean and maintainable code
- Test to be sure the code is doing what is intended, being careful not to introduce regressions

To understand general context, before we begin a new task, you will read the md files - located at the root of the MD_files folder.
For specific tasks i will write a MD file in MD_files/tasks.
Use standard ASCII characters in MD file update.
Avoid emojis and special Unicode characters when writing to files.
Use simple text descriptions instead of emoji symbols.

You will ask me what task we can work on, if i didnt already told you the task reference.
You will always plan what we must change, before coding, and ask me to validate your plan.
We may iterate in small phases to complete a task in your plan.
After implementing each phase of the plan, you will update the current task MD file (in MD_files/Tasks) we are working on with what has be done and what phases are remaining.
The goal is to be able to resume our work easily if we get interrupted in our task.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

We will code a great game together !
